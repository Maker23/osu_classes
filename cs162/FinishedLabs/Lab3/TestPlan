Design choices. These are not bugs:

	Silently supress blank lines 
 	Output numbers are CRLF separated even if input is not
 	Warn and continue if bad data is found
 	If one or both files are empty that's not an error; silently proceed
 	Command-line arguments are positional, not flag-defined
 	Decimal numbers with no value after the decimal point are converted to
 		integers.  For example, "13.0" will be treated as "13".
 		This is a design decision and not a bug.

Test scenarios. Unless otherwise noted, the program should handle all of these
without error/failure.

Test 
completed
[x]		One or both files does not exist [print an error and exits]
[x]		One or both files exists but not permitted to read [print error and exit]
[x]		Bad (non-integer) values exist (strings, decimal numbers) [warn and skip]

[x]		File number ranges do not overlap, eg, one file is all lower than the other
[x]		One or both files exist but are empty (not an error)
[x]		One file is much shorter than the other
[x]		Input Numbers are either space delimited and CRLF delimited; both work
[x]		Duplicate numbers occur in the same file
[x]		Duplicate numbers are found in fileOne and fileTwo
[x]		Swap input files one and two, output should be the same
[x]		Negative numbers
[x]		Very large positive numbers (< INT_MAX)
