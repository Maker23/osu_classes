Design choices. These are not bugs:

	Silently supress blank lines 
 	Output numbers are CRLF separated even if input is not
 	Warn and continue if bad data is found
 	If one or both files are empty that's not an error; silently proceed
 	Command-line arguments are positional, not flag-defined
 	Decimal numbers with no value after the decimal point are converted to
 		integers.  For example, "13.0" will be treated as "13".
 		This is a design decision and not a bug.

Test scenarios:
  One or both files does not exist (program exits)
  File number ranges do not overlap, eg, one file is all lower than the other
  One or both files exists but not permitted to read; program exits
  One or both files exist but are empty; no error
  One file is much shorter than the other
  Input Numbers are either space delimited and CRLF delimited; both work
  Bad (non-integer) values exist (strings, decimal numbers); warn and skip
  Duplicate numbers occur in the same file
  Duplicate numbers are found in fileOne and fileTwo
  Swap input files one and two, output should be the same
  Negative numbers
  Very large positive numbers (< INT_MAX)
