  Hi Jan, I implemented this lab using class templates, not classes.
  As a result there is only a Templates.h file defining myQueue
  and myStack, and no Templates.cpp file. This is normal/expected

  As usual, you can run the main program with

	./Lab9

  It will ask for a set of integer inputs AND a second set of string inputs. 

  You can run the fully automated tests with

	./test 

  Enjoy!
