        <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Pinterest API calls need to be made on behalf of a
					Pinterest user, so the first thing you need to do is
					get your website user to establish their Pinterest credentials. 
          <p>
					Pinterest uses oAuth 2.0 to authenticate requests from third party
					sites. Requests are sent as POSTS when data is being modified
					and as GETs when data is only being read.
					<p>
					Although the API itself is quite simple, getting the client set up
					correctly to work with Pinterest's authentication was complicated.
					I go into it in some detail below.

				<h3>Getting oAuth working</h3>
        <div class="col-xl-4">
				In theory, oAuth is simple to use, but in practice it can be difficult
				to manage for someone who's new to client-side coding.  oAuth depends
				on tokens that are generated once and then sent with each request.
				<a href="https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/">This overview</a>
				is an excellent refernce to getting oAuth working.
				<p>
				Unfortunately I wasn't able to do everything I wanted. JS closures
				are sufficient for token handling within a single page, but keeping
				a token alive as a user navigates through your site requires 
				persistent token storage. There is probably some way to store the
				token in a more persistent way that lasts beyond a page
				reload, but I wasn't able to discover one during my research.
				<p>
				As a result, although the Pinterest authorization will last through 
				multiple operations on the <a href="/site/pinSearch.html">Searching Pins and Boards</a>
				page, once the user navigates away from that page the token is lost
				and needs to be regenerated.

				<h2><li>Set your web server up for HTTPS</h2>
				<h3>Generate a public and private SSL key</h3>
        <div class="col-xl-4">
				This is the procedure for generating a privately-signed SSL key, which 
				you can use for testing.  To support trusted encryption you'll want to
				get an SSL key from a Certificate Authority (CA). CA's often charge
				a fee for this service. For example, here is <a href='https://www.websecurity.symantec.com/ssl-certificate?om_sem_cid=ws_sem_search|183506567681|%2Bssl%20%2Bcertificated|b|c|&sl=ZEFFZ-0000-01-00&gclid=Cj0KEQiAxeTFBRCGmIq_7rGt_r8BEiQANdPqUur_3i1PBrg6wl2uJ4IZUKRI-0z4B2vBfEBwfT2HejoaAveO8P8HAQ'>Symantec's</a> purchasing page.
				<p><br></p>
				The steps below will leave you with two files, cert.pem (the certificate) and 
				key.pem (the private key)
				<pre>
openssl genrsa -out key.pem
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem
openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem
rm csr.pem
				</pre>
				<p>
				</div>
				<h3>Add HTTP support to your Server.js file</h3>
        <div class="col-xl-4">
				<p>
				These code snippets demonstrate how to add HTTP support to a Node/Express Server.js file.
				<pre>
// Options tell the SSL layer where to find your key and cert files
var options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync("keys/key.pem"),
  cert: fs.readFileSync("keys/cert.pem")
};

// Set up 'app' as a standard (unencrypted) express web server on port 80
var app = express();
app.use("/",router);
app.listen(80, function() {
  console.log("Listening at Port 80");
});

// Now add an encrypted port to app, using the key files
var appSecure = https.createServer(options, app).listen(443);
				</pre>

				<h2><li>Create a Pinterest App</h2>
				<p> 
				<div class="col-xl-4">
				<h3>Go to <a href="https://developers.pinterest.com">https://developers.pinterest.com</a> </h3>
				to set up a new app. This will grant you an <strong>AppID</strong> 
				and an <strong>App secret</strong> that you will use in your API calls.
				Make a note of your AppID.
				<p>
				You'll need to create a Pinterest login before you can set up an app,
				if you don't already have one. 
				</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xl-4">
				<h3>Add your Pinterest-API-calling website to your App configuration</h3>
				Choose a page on your local website that you'll redirect users to after they 
				authenticate with Pinterest, and add this page to the list of valid 
				<strong>Redirect URLs</strong> for your Pinterst app.  Make sure to end
				your URL with a "/". <strong>Note that you must use https targets as your 
				redirects</strong>.
				</div>
        <div class="col-xl-4">
        <h3>Authenticating Users</h3>
          <p>
					oAuth is a two-step process.  In the first step your application 
					or web site will sent a GET request to Pinterest, containing 
					your public AppID. With this request you will redirect the user 
					to a Pinterest login screen where they will enter their Pinterest 
					login information; if they're successful, Pinterest will return 
					a temporary authorization code.
					<p>
					<p>
					In the second step your app or site uses the temporary authorization
					to send a POST request to Pinterest. This request contains your AppID, the
					authorization code from step&nbsp;1, and your <strong>App secret</strong>.
					<p>
					The response from step&nbsp;2 is an <strong>access token</strong> that 
					can be re-used for many user requests.  Access tokens are theoretically
					time-limited, but Pinterest (and many other sites) set the timeout to
					a very high number. In effect the user will remain authenticated as long
					as they're using your site.
