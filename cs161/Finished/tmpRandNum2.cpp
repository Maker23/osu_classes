 *  Filename: randNum2.cpp
 *
 *  Overview:
 *		Write a piece of code that acts like a random number generator with 
 *		the following behavior: File must be called: randNum2.cpp 
 *		(Note: you can use the rand function in your function, you do not 
 *		have to make your own random number generator code from scratch!)
 *
 *		a. it should ask for two int values (one for the minimum value for some
 *			random number in a range and one for the maximum number in the range),
 *		b. check that the values entered were int values, (Note: there are a
 *			number of ways user input can be incorrect, so think of a few ways
 *			input could be incorrect and implement them in code if you can)
 *		c. generate a number within that range, 
 *		d. assign the number generated to some variable, 
 *		e. and print out the value along with some explanation so the user 
 *			knows what the value is for (you will not always want to print values 
 *			out, but in this case we want to see that our code is working)
 * 
 *	Discuss on Discussion Board: What ways did you think of that user input 
 *	could be incorrect for this problem, how might you be able to detect and 
 *	possibly correct those errors, and were you able to implement it?
 *
 *	Discuss on Discussion Board: I am guessing you may find ways to do this 
 *	with a one line expression, so feel free to share why it might be a good 
 *	idea or bad idea to have this as a few separate lines instead of as a one 
 *	line expression in our code?
