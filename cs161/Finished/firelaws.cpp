 *  Overview:
 *    Write a program that determines whether a meeting room is in violation of
 *    fire law regulations regarding the maximum room capacity.The program will
 *    read in the maximum room capacity and the number of people to attend the
 *    meeting. If the number of people is less than or equal to the maximum
 *    room capacity, the program announces that it is legal to hold the meeting
 *    and tells how many additional people may legally attend. If the number of
 *    people exceeds the maximum room capacity, the program announces that the
 *    meeting cannot be held as planned due to fire regulations and tells how
 *    many people must be excluded in order to meet the fire regulations.‚Äù
 *
 *  Input:
 *  	The capacity of the meeting room (an integer)
 *  	The number of people in the meeting (hopefully an integer)
 *
 *  Output:
 *  	Whether the meeting can be held safely in the room; if not, how many 
 *  	people should be excluded from the meeting to make it fire safe.
