CAVEAT:  The readDataFile  code does not do any error checking - it assumes
         the data files are correct.

         Data files are ":" separated lines; three fields for books, two
         for patrons.


I've written some functions to help you debug your Library code.  These
functions will load Book and Member information from data files so you don't
have to type them in over and over.  Because ain't nobody got time for that!!


Before you can use this code you will need

  =  A working implementation of Library::addMember that takes a Patron& argument
  =  A working implementation of Library::addBook that takes a Book& argument

     Note these two are IN ADDITION the  addBook/addMember functions you
     have to write for the assignment that don't take any arguments,  but these
     are dead simple - just push_back the object onto the appropriate vector.
    
     You should create prototypes for these in Library.h as well.
  
      Library::addBook( Book & book)
	    {
		     holdings.push_back(book);
	    }

  =  To figure out what your patron idNums and book idCodes will look like. Don't use mine!



INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  Get the code  files "readDataFiles.h"  and  "readDataFiles.cpp", and the
    data files  "books.data" and "patrons.data", from github.  You can just cut and
    paste the code if you don't want to use github.  

2.  Change "books.data" and "patrons.data"  to use your version of patron
    idNums and Book idCodes

3. In menu.cpp, add this line with your other includes

         #include "readDataFiles.h"

4. Also in menu.cpp, declare the standard arguments to main() and add a line to
   invoke the file-reading code.  The program will invoke the code whenever any
   argument is given to the program.

         int  main (int argc, char** argv)   // declare the arguments
         {

            <... your normal declarations ... >
            Library  myLibrary;  // or whatever you're calling your library


            if (argc > 1)
                readDataFromFile(myLibrary);  // or whatever you called your library


            <... your menu loop ...>

5. Now compile your program; the makefile will automatically build readDataFiles.o

6. Run the program with any argument to load the data files, like  

        ./myprogram x


You may want to write simple debugging functions like Library::listAllBooks()
and Library::listAllPatrons(), but you can do that on your own.  ENJOY AND GOOD LUCK.
